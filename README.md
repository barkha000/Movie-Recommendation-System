## About this project 
In this project i have use python language to build a recommendation engine, in this project i have not use machine learning to build recoomendaton system , in this i have use function ## def_recommend to build recoomendation engine, i have done recoomendation based on language, similar genres, duration of movie, actors. in this it also recommend similar movies. 
In this project i have also calculated profit and loss of movie.
in this project firstly i have read the dataset, then remove the unneccesary columns, then fill the missing value, then remove the duplicates column , then calculated profit and loss of the movie, then plot graph. and at last but not the least i recommended movies on different different categories.
